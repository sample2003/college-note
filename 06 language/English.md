## 疑问词

**疑问词的词性**

who（whom）：名词
whose：形容词
what：名词、形容词
which：名词、形容词
that： 名词、无
when：副词
where：副词
why：副词
how：副词

## 非谓语动词

都不是动词和谓语动词，相较于普通的名词、形容词、副词，保留了动词的特点，可以有时态变化，且可以携带自己的宾语（vt）、状语等等

### 谓语动词 vs 非谓语动词

**Having finished her dinner**(分词), she **decided**(动词) to go for a walk to clear her mind, anticipating to meet her friends and discussing their upcoming travel plans.

1. 一个句子（以句号为单位）只能有一个谓语动词。
2. 除了谓语动词之外的其他动词，必须使用非谓语动词的形式：不定式、动名词、分词

With a beaming smile, she eagerly stepped onto the stage to receive her award, determined to pursue her dreams and inspire others to do the same.

With a beaming smile, (状语)
**she** eagerly **Stepped** (句子整体结构:SV)
onto the stage to receive her award, (状语)
determined to pursue her dreams and inspire others to do the same. (主语补语)

### 不定式

词性：名词、形容词、副词

1. 不定式:不一定是什么词性的一个东西。
2. 不定式具备名词属性、形容词属性、副词属性。
3. 不定式可在句子中作主语、宾语、补语、定语、状语。
4. 虽然不定式被当作名词、形容词、副词来用,但不定式依旧保留了作为动词的特性,比如及物动词可以带宾语,动词可以带状语等等。
5. 不定式中的动词必须有明确的逻辑主语,默认指向句子的主语,如需指向其他对象,可使用介词for、of、with带出不定式单独的逻辑主语。
6. 不定式中的动词如果是及物动词,则必须有逻辑宾语,默认指向句子的名词性成分(主语、宾语、补语)如果找不到合适的逻辑宾语,则会发生语法错误。
7. 逻辑主语、逻辑宾语并不是不定式特有的要求,所有的非谓语动词都有这种要求。

- It is foolish **to lie**. (主语)
- Our plan is **to finish the work in two weeks**.(表语/补语)
- Sally doesn't like **to be praised**.(宾语)
- The question **to be discussed** is important.(定语)

- My mother's last request [for me to study hard], was never met.

**形容词属性的不定式: 作为后置定语**

句末中心原则的体现:
- At the meeting a **decision** [to transfer a part of the students to another school] was made.

- At the meeting a **decision** was made [to transfer a part of the students to another school].

**副词属性的不定式:作为状语**

- [To improve my English], I went to America. 目的状语
- He went abroad [never to return]. 结果状语
- She wept [to hear the news]. 原因状语

- The old man walked slowly, hunched over, [as if to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders].
方式状语

**副词属性的不定式: 作为插入语**

- [To be fair], he has worked hard these days.

**不定式的逻辑主语、逻辑宾语等问题**

完成时态：to have written
完成进行时态：to have been writing

被动：

完成时态(to have done): 不定式动作在谓语动词动作之前。
进行时态(to be doing): 在谓语动词动作发生时,不定式动作正在进行。
被动式(to be done): 不定式的逻辑主语是不定式动作的对象或承受者。

### 动名词

词性：名词

1. 动名词的构成非常简单:V+ing
2. 在语法层面上,动名词=名词。
3. 动名词=名词, 但保留了动词的一些特征:存在逻辑主语、逻辑宾语、以及其他修饰语, 此外, 动名词可以变换形式(主动式、被动式、完成式等)。

**动名词作主语: 位于句首**
- [Learning] is easy.
- [Learning English] is easy.

- [Talking] is nice.
- [Talking to him] is nice.

- [Walking] is my only exercise.
- [Walking around the school] is my only exercise.

- [Smoking] is bad.

- Larry suggests [playing basketball].
- Sally admitted [taking the money].
- You should avoid [eating too much].
- I like [traveling] very much.
- I hate [lying] and [cheating].

admit, advise, avoid, consider, deny, like, dislike, enjoy, feel like, finish, forgive
give up, can't help, imagine, involve, mention, mind, miss, permit, prohibit, resist, risk,
suggest ......

**动名词作宾语: 介词宾语**
- She insisted on [paying for it].
- Sally couldn't keep from [laughing].
- Michael thought of [writing to me].
- Have you ever dreamed of [becoming a astronaut]?
- I don't feel like [going out today].
- I look forward to [leaving this town] and [starting a new life].
- [From] having parties [to] chatting online, I just love knowing new people.

- I am not [used to] driving fast.
- I [used to] drive fast.

**动名词作宾语: 特殊句型**

Have difficulty/trouble/problems/a hard time/... (in)doing sth. (做某事遇到了困难)
- I once had a hard time [getting used to living in Beijing].

can't help/resist doing, can't keep from doing... (情不自禁做某事)
- I can't help [reading this book]. It's so much fun.
- No one can help [liking Tom]; he is such a cute boy.

其他句型
- This book is worth [reading].

**动名词作表语**
- Talking to him is [talking to a wall].
- Sally's hobby is [painting].
- Their pastime is [going to movies].
- Her favorite sport is [skiing].
- Michael's job is [taking care of the sheep on the farm].
- Seeing is [believing].

**动名词作定语**
- a sleeping bed
- a reading room
- a swimming pool
- a washing machine

- a flying jacket[动名词] = a jacket for flying = 飞行夹克(飞行员穿的夹克)
- a flying jacket[分词] = a jacket that is flying = 飞行的夹克(会飞的夹克) [jacket和flying构成主谓关系]

同理:
a sleeping bed[动名词] = 睡觉用的床 √ 在睡党的床 x
reading materials[动名词] = 阅读材料 √ 正在阅读的材料 x

**动名词的逻辑主语问题**

- Sally insisted on [reading the letter].
- Sally insisted on [my reading the letter].
- Sally insisted on [reading the letter]. (默认的逻辑主语:Sally)
	Sally坚持要看信。
- Sally insisted on my reading the letter.(逻辑主语:I)
	Sally坚持要我看信。

**动名词的逻辑主语问题: 所有格 or Not?**
- [Her going off in such a hurry] is strange.
- I'm not happy about [Michael's forgetting to pay].
- I remember [him doing this before].

- [Her/Sally's going off in such a harry] is strange.(主语:所有格)
- I'm not happy about [Sally(Sally's) going off in such a hurry]. (宾语:二者皆可)
- I'm not happy about [someone going off in such a hurry]. (不定代词:普通格)
- I've always had a dream of [my father, mother, and I living together]. (逻辑主语太长:使用普通格)

**动名词的语态、语气问题**

主动
一般时态：writing
完成时态：having written
进行时态：没有
完成进行时态：没有

被动
一般时态：being written
完成时态：having been written
进行时态：没有
完成进行时态：没有

**动名词的语态、语气问题: 被动式、完成式**

被动式:逻辑主语作为动作的承受者
- I remember [being taken to Beijing when I was a little kid].
- Sally hates [being called "a beauty"].
- I'm not used to [being treated like that].

完成式:强调动名词结构的动作在谓语动词之前
- He denied [having been there].
- I could not remember [having heard anyone say that before].
- She admits [having seen us].

完成被动式:二合一
- I appreciate [having been given] the chance to study abroad.

**动名词的语态、语气问题:主动形式表被动意思**

- The garden [needs watering]. 花园需要浇水了。
- He [deserved praising]. 他值得被表扬。
- You hair [wants cutting]. 你的头发该剪了。

对比下面两个句子
- He [deserves shooting first].
（shoot(vt)him(主语he) = 动宾关系）
他应该第一个被枪毙。
- He [deserves to shoot first].
（he(主语he)shoot(vi) = 主谓关系）
他应该第一个开枪

现代英语中, 动词deserve, need, require, want, won't bear等之后的动名词, 其主动语态表示被动意义, 动名词与句子主语在逻辑上是动宾关系; 形容词worth, 介词past, beyond后面的动名词, 与上述逻辑类似。
- The garden wants [weeding].
- The truck needs [repairing].
- This book is worth [reading].
- The bad style requires [getting rid of].

**动名词与不定式的区别: **

- I like playing basketball.
- I like to play basketball.
1. 不定式: 强调具体的、一次性的、待实现的动作, 一般与某个特殊的动作执行者联系在一起。
2. 动名词: 一般性事实, 意义上更加抽象, 一般不与特定的动作执行者联系在一起。

- He hates drinking.[讨厌所有人喝酒]
- He hates to drink.[讨厌自己(下一次)喝酒的动作]

动名词的逻辑主语范围更大, 可以泛指所有人; 不定式的逻辑主语通常仅仅是句子中的主语。

- [Being invited to the party] made Michael happy. （已经被邀请了）
- It would make Michael happy [to be invited to the party]. （还没被邀请）
- What he always wishes is [angling for compliments]. （不受时间限制
- What he wishes now is [to angle for compliments]. （表示将来的行为）

动名词作主语通常表示已经实现的行为,或者不受时间限制的行为; 不定式作主语表示将要实现、但仍未实现的行为。

有些动词只能后接动名词:
- She decided to avoid [eating sugary foods].
- Michael admit [stealing the money].

既然已经avoid(避免)了, 当然就不应该存在下一次动作, 所以to do是不合适的; admit也类似, 承认的事情, 必然是已经发生过的,不应该是表达未来动作的to do。

有些动词只能后接不定式:
- We can't afford [to buy such an expensive house].
- They chose [to pay a visit to America].

afford也好, choose也好, 都是必然有后续动作的, 于是afford to buy, choose to pay也是一种必然。

有时候意思相仿:
- Prices continue [to rise].
- Prices continue [rising].
- Sally started [to cry].
- Sally started [crying].

有时候意思区别很大:
- Sally stopped [crying].
- Sally stopped [to cry].

- Remember [to mail this letter] tomorrow.
- I don't remember [mailing the letter].

- I hate [to trouble you].
- I hate [troubling you].

- I cannot help [to repair the car].
- I cannot help [laughing].

### 分词

词性：形容词、副词

1. 分词保留了动词的很多特征,比如可以带自己的宾语、状语、
表语、补语等。
2. 在句子中分词被视为形容词性成分 or副词性成分,即,定
语 or 状语 or 补足语。

## 简单句的五种基本句型

1. 主谓：She[主语] smiled[不及物动词]. 
2. 主谓宾：I[主语] love[及物动词] you[宾语]. 
3. 主系表：That[主语] sounds[系动词] good[表语]. 
4. 主谓宾补：I[主语] find[及物动词] the movie[宾语] interesting[宾语补语]. 
5. 主谓双宾： Larry[主语] bought[及物动词] me[间接宾语] a book[直接宾语]. 

## 并列句

简单句1 and/but/or 简单句2 and/but/or 简单句n

## 主从句

从句 = 连词（疑问词） + 简单句

### 从句

**如何学好从句**
1. 把从句部分看作一个简单句。
2. 作为简单句的从句, 要对应到简单句五种基本句型中的一种。
3. 从句的主谓宾定状补, 都要清楚地找出来。
4. 判断 **关系词(连词)** 在从句中担任何种成分,如果从句的主谓宾俱全,则关系词不可能担任**主语、宾语**等成分,只能充当**副词性**成分, 反之, 关系词则可能充当**主语、宾语**类型的名词性成分。
5. 判断 **关系词(连词)** 是否可能充当从句中修饰主语的**形容词性成分(限定词成分)**。
6. 按照简单句的陈述语序, **重新理顺从句部分的语序** 。

**独立句子变从句的具体步骤**

1. 调语序,存在倒装语序的,必须调整为陈述语序。
2. 加连词,从句必须有相应的连词来引导, 陈述句用that, 一般疑问句用whether, 特殊疑问句用原本的疑问词作为连词。
3. 把连词置于从句的句首。
  
### 名词性从句

用来代替[[English#简单句的五种基本句型|简单句]]中充当名词属性成分的句子（包含陈述句、一般疑问句、特殊疑问句）称为名词性从句，充当主语的叫主语从句，充当表语的叫表语从句，充当宾语的叫宾语从句，

陈述句：He is a transsexual. i doesn't matter

无需调整语序，并在句首添加连词That，因为原句结构完整，that可以不做任何成分。

**That he is a transsexual** doesn't matter.  [主语从句]
I don't know **that he is a transsexual**.  [宾语从句]
The problem is **that he is a transsexual**.  [表语从句]

一般疑问句：Is he a transsexual

调整语序：he is a transsexual，调整语序后句意损失，他是不是变性人 --> 他是变性人，要加一个表示 是否（Whether） 的连词完整句意。

**Whether he is a transsexual** doesn't matter.  [主语从句]
I don't know **Whether he is a transsexual**.  [宾语从句]
The problem is **Whether he is a transsexual**.  [表语从句]

特殊疑问句：What he is

调整语序：he is what，因为what本身就有连词的作用，直接将what置于句首就可以。

**What he is** doesn't matter.  [主语从句]
I don't know **what he is**.  [宾语从句]
The problem is **what he is**.  [表语从句]

主语从句：
**What you decide** will greatly impact our future.  
[What do you decide?]
**Whether he is guilty or innocent** remains to be seen.  
[Is he guilty or innocent?]
**How we handle this situation** is crucial for our success.  
[How do we handle this situation?]

宾语从句:
She believes **that education is the key to a better world**.  
[education is the key to a better world.]
I wonder **why he didn't show up at the meeting**.  
[Why didn't he show up at the meeting?]
Can you explain **how this machine works**?
[How does this machine work?]

表语从句:
His dream is **that he becomes a successful entrepreneur**.  
[He becomes a successful entrepreneur.]
The problem seems to be **that we lack proper communication**.  
[We lack proper communication.]
The truth is **that we all make mistakes**.  
[We all make mistakes.]

同位语从句，
>同位语，就是针对抽象名词的**名词性**解释说明

Michael, **my friend**, is a good guy.
My favorite subject, **mathematics**, requires logical thinking.
Her goal, **becoming a doctor**, requires years of study and dedication.
The news, **that they won the championship**, spread quickly.
The fact, **that she lied**, disappointed everyone.
I have no idea **what has happened to him**.
My original doubt, **why she did that**, has not been answered.
The last question, **what measures should be taken**, was fully discussed.

**疑问词作主语，则无需变更语序**

Why are you laughing?
[I don't know why you are laughing.]
Where does Sally live?

### 形容词性从句

也叫定语从句 
各种关系词

**主语关系代词:  who、which、 that**
1. who(指代某人)、which(指代某人)、that(某人/某物)这三个关系代词都可以作定语从句的主语, 但是要注意: 用来指代人时, who比that常用; 用来指代物时候, that比which常用, 这是英美人使用关系代词的基本习惯。
	- He is reading a book **that is about human history**. 
	- A rich person is not one **who has the most**, but is one **who needs the least**. 
2. 使用关系代词后，从句中原本被关系代词指代的部分（主语）必须删掉。
   - I like friends **who they are passionate fans of Kobe Bryant**.
   - 改：I like friends **who are passionate fans of Kobe Bryant.**
3. 先行词的性质=关系词的性质，二者必须在单复数、主格宾格等等方面保持统一。
	- Music **that have great lyrics** is my favorite. 
	- 改：Music **that has great lyrics** is my favorite. 

**宾语关系代词(动词宾语):  who、whom、which、that**
1. who（指代某人）、whom（指代某人）、which（指代某物）、that（指代某人/某物）
2. 上述四个关系代词都可以作为形容词性从句中动词的宾语, 也可以省略。
	- I want to have a friend **who/whom/that/不填 I can fully trust**.
	- Michael likes every piece of music **that/which/不填 I recommend**.
	- This is the book **that/which/不填 I bought yesterday**.
3. 使用了关系代词后, 从句中原本被关系代词指代的部分(宾语)必须删掉。
4. 关系代词与从句谓语动词距离较远的时候, 要注意分辨清楚句子的结构, 一定要找到真正的谓语动词, 同时把从句作为一个简单句来分析, 将其对应到简单句五种基本句型中的一种, 尤其当存在双宾语、宾语补语等结构时, 要仔细分析这个“简单句”。

**宾语关系代词(介词宾语):  who、whom、which**
1. 定语从句中大多数作为宾语的关系代词是可以省略的。
2. 如果定语从句的主语是比较长的名词短语, 或者先行词与定语从句被其他成分隔开(距离较远)，尽量不要省略关系代词。句子容易造成歧义时, 不要省略关系代词。
3. 作为介词宾语的关系代词, 在介词后置的情况下, 用法和动词宾语相同; 介词前置的情况下,只能使用 prep+whom 以及 prep+which的形式, 而不能使用prep+that。
4. 短语动词中的介词,一般不前置。

**状语关系副词:  when, where, why**
1. where、when、why这三个是关系副词，也是连词；
2. where，先行词：地点名词；在定语从句中担当的成分：地点状语；
3. when，先行词：时间名词；在定语从句中担当的成分：时间状语；
4. why，先行词：原因名词；在定语从句中担当的成分：原因状语；

**定语关系限定词: whose、which**
1. 补语关系代词：which、that
简单句1：Michael lives in a housse.
简单句2：The roof of the housse is leaking.

- 两个句子之间存在交叉关系：house <-> the roof of the house
- 使用关系词进行替换：the roof of [the house] <-> the roof of which
- 结果：the roof of the house is leaking. -> the roof of which is leaking.
- 关系词（of which）提前：
  Michael lives in a house **of which the roof is leaking.**
  Michael lives in a house **whose roof is leaking.**
2. whose表示所有格，构成[whose+名词]结构；which起指示作用，构成[which+名词]结构
- That guy [whose dad is a billionaire] wasted a lot of money.
- That guy whose dad is a billionaire wasted a lot of money, which fact is hard to believe.
3. whose可以作[人]的所有格，也可以用作[物]的所有格
- I know a doctor [whose three sons are all doctors].
- Sally studies in a school [whose students study like machines].
- Sally studies in a school [whose students study like machines].

不使用whose,使用其他关系词将上面的句子改写成意思接近的形容词性从句:
- Sally studies in a school [where the students study like machines].
- Sally studies in a school [in which the students study like machines].

**补语关系代词: which、that**
- Sally is a smart person, which I am not.
- The nickname stupid-ass that those classmates named Michael doesn't sound friendly.

**定语从句**
- I don't wear clothes which make me different from other people.
- I don't wear clothes, which makes me different from other people.

**限制性 & 非限制性定语从句**
1. 非限制性定语从句的简单判断
	1. 有逗号。
	2. 关系词只能用which(极少用that),who(极少用that),where,when。
		- I don't wear clothes, which makes me different from other people.
		- Michael knows a doctor, who has three sons working in the hospital.
		- This is the school, where we made lifelong friendships.
		- I still remember the summer, when we had an unforgettable road trip.
2. 非限制性 vs 限制性，看前面的名词有没有被筛选，
	- I don't wear clothes, which makes me different from other people.
	- I don't wear clothes which make me different from other people.

	- Michael knows a doctor, who has three sons working in the hospital.
	- Michael knows a doctor who has three sons working in the hospital.

	- This is the school, where we made lifelong friendships.
	- This is the school where we made lifelong friendships.

	- I still remember the summer, when we had an unforgettable road trip.
	- I still remember the summer when we had an unforgettable road trip.
3. 非限制性定语从句的先行词更加多样化
	- Beijing, which is a great city, attracts visitors from around the world.
	- Beijing,)which is a great city, attracts visitors from around the world.
	
	- Beijing attracts visitors from around the world, which is great.
	- Beijing attracts visitors from around the world, which is great.
	
	- They said that I took the books, which was just not true.
	- They said that I took the books, which was just not true.
	
	- Michael plays basketball, which I don't.
	- Michael plays basketball, which I don't.
	
	- Michael likes playing basketball, which is a good sport.
	- Michael likes playing basketball, which is a good sport.
4. 某些先行词，只能使用非限制性定语从句，而不能使用限制性定语从句
第一种：专有名词作先行词：地点
- 非限制性
	Beijing, which is capital of China, is a great city.
	(There is only one Beijing in this world.)
- 限制性
	The Beijing that used to be the capital of old china is liked by nobody.
	(There are two Beijing-s: The old Beijing, and the new Beijing)
- 大多数情况下,类似Beijing这样的专有名词做先行词的时候,都必须使用加逗号的非限制性定语从句,因为专有名词是独一无二的,因此无法被“限制”,更无需指定。
	Beijing which is capital of China is a great city. [X]
第二种：专有名词作先行词：人物
- 非限制性
	Einstein, who was a great scientist, created the theory of relativity.
	(There is only one Einstein in this world, though he's dead already.)
- 限制性
	The Einstein who was played by fgen in that movie looks funny.
	(There can be various Einsteins in lots of movies)

### 副词性从句

1. 也叫状语从句，本质就是一个句子作副词
	- Sally runs **really fast**.
	- Sally runs **as if she is flying**.
	
	- Michael never gets up early **on Sundays**.
	- Michael never gets up early **when he doesn't go to school on Sundays**.
	
	- Sally was happy **in Beijing**.
	- Sally was happy **when she could play with her friends in Beijing**.
2. 副词性从句（转喻从句）的本质就是包含完整主谓结构的句子，作为副词性成分，对主句进行修饰，修饰的对象一般是主句的谓语动词、主句的表语形容词等。

I **hated** everybody around me back then.(描述事实)

I **was hating** everybody around me back then.(主观色彩浓厚)

#### 现在完成时

形式:have/has+V-ed；现在完成时表达的意义远大于“已完成”；不能与表示过去的时间状语连用；

1.  已完成用法:表示过去的某个动作已完成,且该动作的完成与当前的情况有联系,完成时的“已完成”表示一种因果关系,动作的完成是原因,而当前的情况是结果。/第四类动词居多/

He **has turned off** the light.(含义:Now the light is off.)

I **'ve laid** the table.(含义:It's time to eat.)

He **has recovered** from his illness.(含义:Now he is well.)

I **'ve studied** English.(含义:Iknow English.)

I **'ve changed** my attitude.(含义:Now I have a new attitude.)

已完成用法可以和下面几类时间状语连用:

a、表示不确定过去时间的状语:already, yet,before, recently, lately ...
b、频度时间状语:often,sometimes,ever, never, once, twice ...
c、包今当前时间状态在内的时间状语·now.iust. today. this morning, this vear ..

2. 未完成用法:表示动作或状态从过去某时开始,持续到现在,此状态可能仍将继续下去,也
可能刚刚结束,抑或表示一段时间内反复发生的动作。一般与时间段状语连用。

第一类、第二类动词肯定式
He **has volunteered** in the orphanage for years.
Michael **has lived** here since 2018.
I **'ve** always **missed** her.

第二类、第四类动词否定式,表示状态延续至今
I **haven't seen** her for years.
They **haven't visited** us since 2015.
He **hasn't written** to me for a whole year.
I **haven't talked** with my mom since we had a fight last time.

#### 现在完成时中【since】的用法

1. 【since】既是介词,又是连词

 I haven't seen him since yesterday.

 I haven't seen him since we ran into each other in Paris last year.

2. 与现在完成时搭配使用的【since】，应该后接时间点；如果后接动词一般过去时所表示的时间段，则容易产生歧义；如果后接动词的现在完成时所表示的时间段，则没有歧义。

I haven't seen him since yesterday.(√)【since】+ 时间点

I haven't seen him since we ran into each other in Paris. (√)【since】+时间点

He hasn't written to me since he lived in Beijing.(?)【since】+一般过去时的时间段

He has taken extra care of me since I was ill.(?)【since】+一般过去时的时间段

He hasn't written to me since he has lived in Beijing.(√)【since】+现在完成时的时间点

He has taken extra care of me since I've been ill.(√)【since】+现在完成时的时间点

3. It is 时间名词 +【since】

. It is a long time since we met last.

. It's been a long time since we met last.
